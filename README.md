# ADC_Read_In_Series
 Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) is a system that converts continuous analog signals into discrete digital values for processing by digital systems. It samples the analog input at regular intervals, quantizes the amplitude into a finite number of levels, and outputs a binary representation. ADCs are essential in bridging the gap between analog real-world signals (e.g., sound, temperature) and digital devices, with applications in electronics, data acquisition, and control systems. Key parameters include resolution (bit depth), sampling rate, and accuracy.n this project, we developed an ADC system and presented its layout, schematic, and simulation results.
The system (as shown in Figure 1) transmits the outputs of the priority encoder controlled by the output of a 2x4 decoder, which receives its inputs from different frequency dividers for a specific clock input. The outputs are routed through a TG-SWITCH, enabling bit-by-bit output of the digital signal.
